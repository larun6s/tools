# 1.  DAPy
## Product Outcome
1. NDepth passive roll out with 50% reduction in time to crawl and 1% increase in coverage
2. Upcoming march rollout
   1. Reduces time to crawl by 40% and coverage improvement by 5% at least across all crawler processes.(This is exapolated data based on NDepth bi-weekly rollout)
   2. Eliminates crawler  processes's manual intervension 100%.
   3. Saves 10 days per month from mundane redandant tasks.
3. Built platform enables different crawlers/collectors with Crawlling Best Practices and production ready core crawling compoenents.
4. Crawler processes are automated end to end
5. CMS tool ready for user testing which enables seamless BA operations and input ingestion for different crawler processes
## Execution Outcomes
### Planning
1. DAPy project plan established an example for efficient project planning with appropriate documentation tools. The tool enables progress/accountability monitoring and call for action when required.
2. Followed SDLC best practices during reviews, pair coding improved team's tech operations efficiency and SDLC skills
3. DAPy does not depend on Azure by architecture and design so AWS migration will be seamless
### Innovation
1. DAPy's core capanilities, crawling best practices, metrics generating tools are 100% configurable and extensible.
3. CJS retriable/resumable workflow enabled crawler processes end to end automation
4. Architected and designed multiple core capabilities to ease typical streaming challenges. Fillowing ar ea few examples
   1. Debuggable topology
   2. Storage Bolt to handle Cloud Storage descrepencies w.r.t File I/O standards
   3. Storage File Rotation policy to produce consistently sized files and handle end of the stream cases
   4. Secret Manager to fetch secrets from approrpriate sources based on env.
   5. Resilient and fault tolerant HTTP Protocols to handle throttling cases effectively with HTTP Proxies
5.  DAPy's architecture and design enables crawlers (built on it) extension with minimal efforts.

# 2.  Mentoring
## EM
EM has become self sufficient to opertate in her capacity with consistent and continual feedback and guidance. Org director involvement in daily operations has been completely eliminated.
## ICs
Taken every PR/Design/Data Analysis revies/pair coding to improve core SDLC skills like sequencing, programming, etc.
Following are a few examples.
1. Navneet has become self sufficiemt at his role and operates 100% independently
2. Samyak is ready to take up complex challenges like CJA end to end automation workflow and work with Infra team with minimal interventiom from EM
3. Vaibhav's code quality improved and made the DAPy subdomain implementation easy to read and debug
4. ANil got familiar with core tech competencies like HTTP, Cloud Storage, SOLID principles, debug/troubleshooting, generate insightful/actionable logs, etc.
